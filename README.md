# Image Colorization Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on converting black-and-white images into colorful, vibrant images using a deep learning model.
The project demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other modern techniques to achieve image colorization.

## Features

* Converts grayscale images into colorized images.

* Utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model for efficient and accurate results.

* Supports batch processing of images.
  
* Easy-to-use interface for uploading and colorizing images.

## Technologies Used

* Programming Language: Python

* Deep Learning Framework: Pytorch

* Dataset: Images from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theblackmamba31/landscape-image-colorization.

* Preprocessing: OpenCV for image manipulation.
